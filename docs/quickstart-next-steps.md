# Next steps

After creating a database and running queries, you have taken the first steps to become a MySQL beginner developer. However, there is still more to learn and practice to improve your skills and knowledge. Some of the next steps you can take are learning and using the following:

- Use different data types, such as integers, strings, dates, and booleans, and how to choose the appropriate one for your data.

- Create and use indexes to optimize the performance of your queries and reduce the load on your database server.

- Combine data from multiple tables and sources using joins, subqueries, and unions.

- Functions, procedures, triggers, and views to encapsulate logic, automate tasks, and create reusable components.

- Use transactions, locks, and isolation levels to ensure data integrity and consistency in concurrent operations.

- Use backup and restore tools to protect your data from loss or corruption.

- Use security features, such as users, roles, privileges, and encryption, to protect your data from unauthorized access or modification.

- Use debugging and testing tools like logs, error messages, breakpoints, and assertions to identify and fix errors in your code or queries.

- Use documentation and commenting tools, such as comments, diagrams, schemas, and manuals, to explain and document your code or queries.

These tasks will expand your knowledge and skills in using Percona Server for MySQL and become more confident and proficient in developing database applications.
